		<h1>Media Planning Resources</h1>
		<p>We subscribe to the full range of media planning tools and use the 
		ACNielsen Media Research suite combined with strategic thinking to 
		develop tailored strategies. Media planning is more than just numbers 
		and reach, equally important is the media environment, consumer 
		attitudes, the budget resource, and the personality of the brand.</p>
<h2>Connecting to your brand</h2>
<p>We like to know how our clientâ€™s customers consume their media, to get a 
		feel for what television programmes they may watch, websites they visit, 
		and magazines they might buy.&nbsp; We can use this information to lay the 
		groundwork in connecting to a client brand. A focus on consumer 
		attitudes to advertising, leads to thinking about the best media to use 
		in order to communicate with an audience. We focus on building 
		strategies to reach the right audiences at the right time in places of 
		relevance and in a way that is reflective of the brand. </p>
<h2>Advertising strategies</h2>
<p>Competitive expenditure analysis provides useful industry insights, and a 
		variety of media planning research tools allow us to follow consumer 
		trends and build strategies that are rational, effective advertising 
		solutions for a variety of budgets and across a variety of businesses.
		</p>
<p>Importantly, at Adworx we take a collaborative approach with our 
		clients, which is reflective in maintaining a balance in the working 
		relationship between our clients, media suppliers and creative houses.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We negotiate on our client&#39;s behalf</li>
	<li>We provide pre and post analysis of each campaign</li>
	<li>And, along with audits of activity, we make life easy with a central 
		billing system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On-line Search Specialists </h2>
