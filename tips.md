# Tips and Tricks

**Basic tips when thinking about media planning:**

Know your audience:

* Who they are
* Where they are
* What they read, watch, and listen to

Think about what you want consumers to remember about your organisation and focus on the key proposition.

Build a creative message that clearly delivers on that focus.

**Cost effective brochures:**

DL Brochures are ideal for publications with a small amount of information and are a cost effective option when posting. They are set up as an A4 folded to a final size of 100x210mm. Booklets with a final size of 100x210mm can also be produced by using this template.

DL brochures can be produced in full colour, two colour or one-colour depending on your audience and budget.
