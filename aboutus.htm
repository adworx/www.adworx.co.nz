	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>Adworx was established in 1997, by its owner Gwyn Jones. Gwyn offers a 
	wealth of experience - 15 years working in television and radio sales proved 
	a great base from which to move into the full range of managing media 
	placements and developing media strategies and advertising plans. Having 
	worked on both sides of the fence Gwyn has developed a broad perspective and 
	an understanding of the challenges facing both clients and suppliers; this 
	empathy adds value to the negotiation process and relationship development.</p>
<p>Gwyn recently rounded off her business skills and knowledge,graduating from 
Victoria University with an MBA. Her motivation: to further add value to the 
work she currently offers Adworx clients.</p>
<p>Adworx Advertising and Media is a small and efficient agency with a great 
track record in both traditional and new &amp; emerging media.<!-- #EndEditable --></div>
