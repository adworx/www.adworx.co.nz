The brief was to develop a media campaign to reach a notoriously difficult youth audience. Our options were further complicated by the need to concentrate on regional reach, against an active competitor, and at a time of year when most other industry players also actively recruit.

Working with an innovative and forward thinking client and in conjunction with NZ Bus we developed a new distribution channel as part of our approach.

**Concept**:

<p>
<img border="0" src="images/bus_hangers_web.jpg" width="200" height="155" style="border: 3px double #808080" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="3">Promotional 
hangers for interiors of buses, targeting the student age commuters who use the 
bus service in and around Wellington.&nbsp; </p>

These hangers could be taken off the overhead hand rails or used to access the sms txt code to receive additional information on Whitiriea Semester 1 courses. Not only did the hangers elicit complimentary feedback from the public, it also proved to be a clean campaign for the bus company to run (no rubbish left in bus aisles).

To increase this reach we used billboard in a directional manner:

<p style="text-align: center">
<img border="0" src="images/billboard_polytech.jpg" width="319" height="149" style="border: 3px double #808080" hspace="8" vspace="3"><img border="0" src="images/bus_polytech.jpg" width="318" height="149" style="border: 3px double #808080" hspace="8" vspace="3"></p>

Plus regional TV with a call for response action through sms text message service.&nbsp; We also used bus 24â€™ exterior panels and small space interior side panels.

say never work with Children or pets, but these puppies were just too divine not 
to use on a TV ad to raise awareness for the annual Royal NZ Foundation of the 
Blind - Red Puppy Appeal. </p>

We integrated this Appeal with online, adshels and print and raised a record 
sum for this charity client.
