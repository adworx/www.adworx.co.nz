		  <h2>Te Puni K&#333;kiri (Ministry of M&#257;ori Development)</h2>
		  <p>
		    &quot;With a limited budget but a big challenge, Gwyn listened to us and created a tailor made package targeting our key ethnic and regional demographics: I'm convinced this helped make our inaugural event a success. Quick to respond to queries, professional and personable, Gwyn is a pleasure to work with.&quot;

		<div class="box"><h2>Whitireia Polytechnic</h2>
		
			<p>&quot;Adworx is successful in meeting the diverse marketing needs of 
			Whitireia. Whitireia aims to reach a broad target market from young 
			school leavers, middle-aged people changing careers, people studying 
			for leisure to industry professionals who require up skilling. </p>
			<p>Through the use of a variety of contemporary mediums Adworx 
			strategically plans how each group is best targeted, maximising 
			brand awareness and positioning media in the most effective places. 
			This has included the use of media like TV commercials, billboards, 
			adshells, bus hangers and an outdoor text campaign. </p>
			<p>With Adworx managing the strategic side of campaigns this frees 
			up time for the marketing department to be working on other 
			projects. Whitireia has a strong relationship with Adworx who 
			continually delivers quality work which is timely and innovative, 
			maximising value for money.&quot;</p>

		<div class="box"><h2>The Cotton Store</h2>
		
			<p>&quot;Working with Adworx has opened up new thinking about how we 
			brand and advertise The Cotton Store. With a conservative budget our 
			small space ads help maximise our reach, and it is valuable to work 
			with a company that is independent so that new opportunities are 
			considered with an unbiased view.&quot;</p>
			<p>More testimonials will be added to this site soon.</p>
