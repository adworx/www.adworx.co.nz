# About Us

Adworx was established in 1997, by its owner Gwyn Jones. Gwyn offers a wealth of experience - 15 years working in television and radio sales proved a great base from which to move into the full range of managing media placements and developing media strategies and advertising plans. Having worked on both sides of the fence Gwyn has developed a broad perspective and an understanding of the challenges facing both clients and suppliers; this empathy adds value to the negotiation process and relationship development.

Gwyn recently rounded off her business skills and knowledge, graduating from Victoria University with an MBA. Her motivation: to further add value to the work she currently offers Adworx clients.

Adworx Advertising and Media is a small and efficient agency with a great track record in both traditional and new &amp; emerging media.
