		<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
		<p><b>Basic tips when thinking about media planning:</b></p>
<p>Know your audience:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Who they are</li>
	<li>Where they are</li>
	<li>What they read, watch, and listen to</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about what you want consumers to remember about your organisation and 
focus on the key proposition.</p>
<p>Build a creative message that clearly delivers on that focus.<p><b>Cost 
effective brochures:</b></p>
<p>DL Brochures are ideal for publications with a small amount of information 
and are a cost effective option when posting. They are set up as an A4 folded to 
a final size of 100x210mm. Booklets with a final size of 100x210mm can also be 
produced by using this template. </p>
<p>DL brochures can be produced in full colour, two colour or one-colour 
depending on your audience and budget. </p>
